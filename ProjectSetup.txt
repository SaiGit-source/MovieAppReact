1. Open folder in VScode
2. Open Terminal
3. Run 'npm create vite@latest' -> ProjectName: MovieApp
4. Framework: React
5. Variant: Javascript
6. cd .\MovieApp\
7. package.json contains dependencies for application including React framework
8. npm install will read dependencies from package.json and install into local machine
9. run 'npm install'
10. now we have the node_modules folder -> thats where all dependencies for our project live
11. index.html -> thats where we actually inject our React code
12. whatever code we write, we pretty much throw them into this div '<div id="root"></div>'
13. inject code into '<div id="root"></div>' then React can take control of the codes
14. run 'npm run dev' -> will development server on local machine and spin up React application on it so we could view it on a specific port 
15. runs on 'Local:   http://localhost:5173/'
16. it has hot reload, when i save changes, server will automatically refresh
17. open 'src' folder -> all .jsx extension -> when you write React code, save as .jsx not .js
18. if you open main.jsx, we are looking for root div within index.html and rendering the component in that: 'document.getElementById('root')' -> this code gets injected into webpage
19. .jsx is the combination of javascript and html
20. lets clear out code in App.jsx and render only a single div


App.js
function App() {

  return (
      <div>

      </div>
  )
}
this is a component that means, any function in Javascript that returns some kind of JSX code

separate out components, things that are calling APIs, css etc -> create a folder components

conditional rendering in React : we render based on some kind of condition

the other concept is pages: we can navigate between 'pages' using page router -> two files: Home.jsx to display all movies, Favorites.jsx to display a list of favorite movies

States: how do we handle dynamic parts of our components and how do we maintain things like State. count of something or text of users typing in

To setup Page navigation, we setup with something called as "React router", stop server -> enter "npm install react-router-dom"

we create another component called as "NavBar" this will keep the list of all navigation links -> Homepage, Favoritespage etc

for stylesheet, we got to make a new folder "css"

we want to get the list of movies from "www.themoviedb.org" using the API and API Key -> fillout form and create an API key
create new folder services and create a new file api.js not jsx

useEffects allows us to use all these api functions -> go to Home

Next to make favorite button work, we shouldn't reset state when we refresh application otherwise persist state
